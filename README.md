# David Hockney, where everything has color: exploring the color system and palette throughout more than seven decades of creative work.

This work sought to find a way to analyze David Hockney's entire catalog of work. In the absence of a database containing all the information, we opted to use a sample of works available on the author's website. Among the available options, the focus was on paintings using traditional techniques and digital illustrations. A total of 412 pieces were found.
